# N-notes
A repo for proof of concept and to help to see how a simple note app application can be transformed from a monolithic architecture  to  an event-driven architecture ðŸ‘½. 

# The Problem Space
This process is about having a clear understanding of what we are budling and only adding true value to the application,
we do this by defining the following:
- The actors in the app/system.
- The core process and its rules.
- The grouping of related process under a context.

## The Actors
- Note-owner

#### The Core process of the Note-owner
- create notes
- update notes
- delete notes
- share notes

## The context
 - Notes
 
 
 ---
 
 # The solution space
 This process is about implementation of the problem space by keeping in mind the the following:
 - The use-cases
 - coupling
 - Cohesion

## The Tech stack - Framwork and language
- ASP.NET Core
- flutter
- dart
- C#
